# Gulp Starter
This repo is a gulp starter for any SCSS/JavaScript (ES6 supported) project.

###### Make sure to have Gulp install globally. If you don't have Gulp yet, run `npm install gulp -g` to install it

## Step 1
Run `npm install` to install de required dependencies.

## Step 2
Run `gulp default` to start the development server. This will automatically open a tab in your default browser.

## Optional
Run `gulp build` to generate the `dist` folder which holds all the minified files.
This is the folder which you would normally upload to your web host.
